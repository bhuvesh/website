# Biography

I am a Computer Science PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://www.scs.gatech.edu/"> School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jabernethy9/">Prof. Jacob Abernethy</a> and <a href="http://jamiemorgenstern.com/">Prof. Jamie Morgenstern</a>. I am broadly interested in machine Learning and algorithmic economics. My work focuses on designing machine learning systems with theoretical foundations operating under the presence of social and economic forces. It spans emerging fields such as mechanism design, robust machine learning, active learning, federated learning, and fairness and privacy in machine learning. 

I graduated from <a href = "http://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT Kanpur</a>, India with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering where I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/">Prof. Purushottam Kar</a> and <a href="http://www.prateekjain.org/">Dr. Prateek Jain</a>.

 <p style="color:rgb(255,37,0);">I am (hopefully) graduating in December 2022 and I am on the job market for industry research positions.</p>
